The Pearson correlation coefficient (r) is the most common way of measuring a linear correlation.
It is a number between –1 and 1 that measures the strength and direction of the relationship between two variables.
When r is between 0 and 1, it is positive correlation. When one variable changes, the other variable changes in the same direction.
When r is 0, there is no correlation and there is no relationship between the variables.
When r is between 0 and –1, it is negative correlation. When one variable changes, the other variable changes in the opposite direction.
